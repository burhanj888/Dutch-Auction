# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

To deploy app on ipfs: 
ipfs add -r build
ipfs name publish <hash>

dApp deployed on : ipns://k51qzi5uqu5di3azh2l0h5a93s5ytthgelc39em1735sdmi9hcazmvxhsj0h26/
